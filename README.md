### 🏢 Invisible Technologies – Applied AI & Workflow Automation

A significant portion of my recent work has been dedicated to enhancing Invisible Technologies' internal agentic automation engine. In this role, I design, implement, and refine production workflows that merge LLM reasoning, structured task orchestration, and data-driven automation.

Due to confidentiality agreements, the source code and architectural details of these projects are private. However, my key contributions include:

*   **Agentic Workflow Design:** I construct scalable, YAML-defined automations that incorporate reasoning steps, validation layers, and execution delegates.
*   **Prompt Vetting & Embedding Pipelines:** I have developed Python-based systems to pre-screen LLM inputs, utilizing vector similarity and local embedding searches for robust quality control.
*   **Execution Orchestration:** I am a contributor to the company's modular step execution system, which includes open-source components like `cem-step-execution`.

These systems are now fundamental to Invisible’s AI-driven process automation platform, serving a diverse range of client verticals.

### 🧠 Melanoma Detection – Deep Learning Thesis

**🎓 GitHub: [MelanomaDetection](https://github.com/manupa14/MelanomaDetection)** 

This project is an end-to-end CNN-based melanoma classifier, which was developed as my final thesis for my Information Systems Engineering degree. The classifier is trained on dermoscopic imagery and leverages ResNet-like convolutional blocks and metadata-aware preprocessing.

*   Combines image analysis with patient metadata to improve diagnostic precision.
*   Demonstrates a practical application of deep learning in the medical field.

### 💳 AutoPaymentApp – Python Web Automation

**🛠️ GitHub: [AutoPaymentApp](https://github.com/manupa14/AutoPaymentApp)** 

This is a lightweight automation tool built with Python and Selenium, designed to handle repetitive payment workflows.

*   Features spreadsheet parsing, state validation, and robust error handling within the browser automation.
*   Originally developed for internal use at Invisible Technologies and was later generalized and open-sourced.
