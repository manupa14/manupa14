## 🏢 Invisible Technologies – Production Contributions

I actively contribute Python code to Invisible’s internal automation infrastructure. This includes:

- ⚙️ **LLM Prompt Vetting Automation**  
  Developed a production-grade Python module that auto-accepts or rejects prompts based on **vector similarity analysis** using a local embedding model and vector database (approximate k-NN).  
  Purpose: auto-filter malformed prompts before reaching human QA or LLM evaluation.

- 🔁 **Workflow Step Execution System**  
  Merged PRs into Invisible’s public `cem-step-execution` repo, part of the company’s orchestration framework for process automation.  
  Focus: modular Python automation blocks for step-level logic and execution chains.
